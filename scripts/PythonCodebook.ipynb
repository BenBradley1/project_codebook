    "Python is one of the most successful programming languages ever, and for a reason! It values *readability* above all else, making it very user-friendly. It is open-source and primarily relies on importing libraries others have created to solve problems efficiently. This means you can lean on the work of others, who have likely solved the problem far more efficiently and cleanly than you could!\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people start using Python via the Python-provided Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or directly through the terminal. These are excellent places to get to grips with Python when first learning the language, as they allow you to focus on the basic coding you'll encounter in tutorials. Complications arrise when you want to do more than the basics though."
